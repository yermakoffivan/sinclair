# prompt roadmap

Sinclair is a terminal emulator written in Rust.

- Feature target: a complete, modern terminal feature set
- Architecture: Zed-style (https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) — a cargo
  workspace of small, focused crates under `crates/`, GPUI for the UI layer.

Conventions (non-negotiable):

- File names: all lowercase, never use spaces, `-`, or `_`. Multi-word concepts
  become nested module directories (`src/grid/scrollback.rs`, never
  `src/grid_scrollback.rs`).
- Small, hyper-focused files.
- Functional style: free functions and plain structs/enums; avoid trait-object
  heavy designs unless genuinely needed.
- Each crate declares its own dependencies in its own `Cargo.toml`.

## Phases

- [x] **1. Core terminal model** — `vt` crate: vte-based parser handling,
  cell/color/sgr, grid + scrollback, primary/alt screens, scroll regions, tab
  stops, cursor save/restore, charsets, modes (DECAWM, DECTCEM, DECOM, 1049,
  2004), OSC title, DSR responses. `pty` crate: openpty, shell spawn, resize,
  read/write. `config` crate: `key = value` config file. `theme`
  crate: ANSI palette, truecolor, builtin schemes. All unit-tested,
  `cargo test --workspace` green.
- [x] **2. Event loop integration** — wire pty output through vt in a
  background thread; terminal state behind a lock; damage tracking; headless
  integration tests (spawn shell, run commands, assert grid contents).
- [x] **3. GPUI app shell** — depend on gpui (zed repo git dep); window,
  monospace grid text rendering, cursor, keyboard input encoding (incl.
  modifiers) written to pty, resize handling.
- [x] **4. Selection & clipboard** — mouse selection (normal/word/line),
  copy/paste, bracketed paste, scrollback scrolling, scroll-to-bottom on
  input. Pulled forward from phase 7: SGR/X10 mouse reporting (1000/1002/
  1003/1006) since app-side mouse plumbing lands here, with shift-bypass
  for selection.
- [x] **5. Tabs & splits** — workspace/pane tree model, keybindings,
  pane resize, tab bar UI.
- [x] **6. Config & themes deep pass** — live reload, all core
  options (fonts, padding, cursor style, shell, keybind = trigger=action,
  window opts), theme option + builtin scheme library. (Deferred to later
  phases: font-feature application → phase 8; GUI runtime verification of
  keybind dispatch.)
- [x] **7. Advanced VT** — mouse reporting modes (phase 4), OSC 52
  clipboard, OSC 4/10/11/12 color queries, focus reporting ?1004,
  synchronized output ?2026 (with a 150ms stuck-sync safety timeout in the
  app), DA2, OSC 8 hyperlinks (vt model + cmd-click-to-open + underline),
  the kitty keyboard protocol, XTGETTCAP. All five kitty enhancement flags
  are encoded — disambiguation, event types, alternate keys, associated text,
  and all-keys-as-escape-codes including the bare modifier keys — over the
  full functional-key table.
- [x] **8. Fonts** — font fallback chain (`font-family` repeats), emoji
  (via the fallback chain + system fallback), ligatures (contiguous-run
  shaping + `calt`), font-feature config (`+liga`/`-calt`/`ss01`/`cv01=2`
  → gpui FontFeatures), box-drawing glyph rendering (custom geometry for
  light lines/junctions, block elements, shades, eighth blocks).
  Remaining for a later polish pass: heavy/double/dashed/rounded box lines
  (currently fall back to font glyphs).
- [x] **9. Shell integration** — OSC 133 semantic prompt marking (A marks
  prompt rows, tracked into scrollback), OSC 7 cwd reporting (phase 6),
  jump-to-prompt (`jump_to_prompt:N` action, default cmd+up/down).
  Deferred: automatic shell-integration *script* injection (the bash/zsh/
  fish hooks that emit these sequences) is shell-side packaging, not
  terminal logic.
- [x] **10. Images & extras** — URL detection (`vt::url`, cmd-click opens a
  detected URL when there is no OSC 8 link), search in scrollback
  (`vt::search` engine + an in-app overlay: cmd+f, live highlight, n/N
  navigation, jump-to-match). Image protocols: sixel (DCS) and the whole kitty
  graphics protocol (APC) are decoded and GPU-composited into the grid,
  anchored to the text they arrived with — every transmission medium, image
  numbers, the full delete table, cropping, cell-box scaling, z-index,
  unicode placeholders, and animation.
- [x] **11. Performance & polish** — parser throughput benchmark
  (`vt/tests/throughput.rs`, including settled resize and scrollback-footprint
  scenarios), row-level snapshot/text-shaping reuse, 60 Hz output coalescing,
  resize debounce, bounded hot scrollback/graphics/input/OSC data, a shared GPU
  texture LRU, event-driven config reload, and public session/render counters.
  See `docs/performance.md` for budgets and repeatable checks.
- [x] **12. Feature coverage audit** — feature-by-feature coverage map in
  `docs/parity.md`, with implemented areas, partial areas, and the
  remaining gaps prioritized.
- [x] **13. Plugin foundation** — manifest plugins under
  `~/.config/sinclair/plugins/*/plugin.toml` (plus explicit `plugin = path`
  config entries). Plugins contribute command actions with optional default
  keybindings, resolved through the same keymap pipeline as built-ins. Command
  targets: focused pane, new tab, right split, down split. Deferred: richer
  extension hosts for themes, languages, and UI surfaces.

## Status log

- 2026-06-12: workspace scaffolded; phase 1 implementation started.
- 2026-06-12: phase 1 complete — vt/pty/config/theme implemented, 196 tests
  green. Phase 2 started: `terminal` crate (pty↔vt runtime) + damage tracking
  in vt.
- 2026-06-12: phase 2 complete — `terminal` runtime + vt damage/bell/title
  signals, 229 tests green. Toolchain updated to rustc 1.96. gpui build recipe
  proven (see gpui.md). Phase 3 started: gpui app shell + `input` crate.
- 2026-06-12: phase 3 complete — windowed terminal works end to end, 283
  tests green, launch smoke test passed, rendering visually verified
  (colors, title, cursor, real zsh session). Phase 4 started: selection,
  clipboard, scrollback scrolling, mouse reporting.
- 2026-06-12: phase 4 complete — selection (cell/word/line), cmd-c +
  copy-on-select, scrollback viewing with stable offset, SGR/X10 mouse
  reporting with shift-bypass, alternate scroll. 351 tests green across 15
  suites, smoke test clean. Phase 5 started: `workspace` crate (pane tree)
  + tabs/splits in app.
- 2026-06-12: phase 5 complete — tabs + splits live (pane tree crate,
  tab bar, divider drag, directional focus, cmd-t/w/d bindings, per-pane
  sessions). 395 tests green across 17 suites. Phase 6 started: config
  deep pass (full option set, keybind parsing, live reload) + builtin
  scheme library + app application of all of it.
- 2026-06-15: phase 6 complete — live config reload wired into the app
  (`app/reload.rs` bridges the config watcher to the gpui foreground;
  `WorkspaceView::reload` rebuilds colors/font/size/padding/cursor/
  copy-on-select and pushes an `Appearance` to every pane). Config
  keybindings now drive the app: hardcoded gpui bindings removed,
  `config::resolve` feeds a `RunBind(index)` data action through one
  dispatcher (`app/keys.rs` maps triggers → gpui keystrokes, unit-tested;
  `clear_key_bindings` + rebind on reload). New actions wired: font
  size inc/dec/reset (live re-measure), scroll page/top/bottom, clear
  screen (form feed), new_split left/up, goto_split prev/next, goto_tab
  (incl. negative), move_tab, toggle_fullscreen, copy/paste via focused
  pane. 460 tests green. Pending: live GUI verification of dispatch;
  font-feature application (phase 8).
- 2026-06-15: phase 7 batch 1 — advanced VT replies/modes landed in `vt`
  (pure, unit-tested): focus reporting (?1004) with `report_focus`/
  `focus_reporting`; synchronized output (?2026) with `synchronized_output`
  accessor; OSC 52 clipboard set (base64 decode in `term/report.rs`,
  surfaced as `terminal::Event::Clipboard`, written to the system
  clipboard by the pane); OSC 4/10/11/12 color queries answered from
  host-installed `ReportColors` (`set_report_colors`, fed from the theme on
  spawn + reload); DA2. App wiring: focus in/out listeners drive ?1004;
  pane installs report colors; clipboard event writes to gpui clipboard.
  475 tests green. Remaining phase 7: OSC 8 hyperlinks, kitty keyboard
  protocol, XTGETTCAP; app frame-gating for ?2026 (needs a stuck-sync
  timeout).
- 2026-06-15: phase 7 batch 2 — OSC 8 hyperlinks and kitty keyboard.
  Hyperlinks: `vt/hyperlink.rs` interns links; `Cell` gains a 2-byte
  `Option<HyperlinkId>` (NonZeroU16 niche); OSC 8 open/close sets the pen
  link; `Terminal::cell_hyperlink`; RIS clears the registry. App: cmd-click
  on a linked cell calls `cx.open_url` (visual underline still TODO).
  Kitty: `vt/kitty.rs` per-screen flag stack with `CSI >/=/< u` push/set/
  pop + `CSI ? u` query + `kitty_keyboard_flags()` accessor (per-screen,
  RIS-reset, all tested); `input/kitty.rs` encodes the disambiguated keys
  (Escape always; ctrl/alt or all-keys text → `CSI codepoint;mods u`),
  deferring everything else to legacy. Limits: press-only (no release/
  repeat events from gpui, so event-type/alternate-key/text flags are
  tracked but not encoded); nav/function keys keep legacy spellings.
  `TermState` gains `kitty_flags`, fed from the terminal. 496 tests green.
- 2026-06-15: phase 7 complete — XTGETTCAP via DCS (`vt/term/dcs.rs`,
  hook/put/unhook; answers Co/colors, TN, RGB, and common booleans; hex
  helpers in report.rs); ?2026 frame-gating in the pane (withhold repaint
  while synchronized, 150ms stuck-sync safety timer via gpui timer+spawn);
  OSC 8 link underline in the element snapshot (linked cells get UNDERLINE,
  spaces included). 503 tests green. Phase 8 (fonts) next.
- 2026-06-15: phase 8 complete — fonts. `font-family` now accumulates into
  a fallback chain (`config::Options::primary_font`/`font_fallbacks`);
  `app/font.rs` builds the gpui Font with primary + `FontFallbacks` +
  `FontFeatures` (parsing `+liga`/`-calt`/`ss01`/`cv01=2`) + base style,
  used by startup and live reload (closes the phase-6 font-feature TODO).
  Emoji ride the fallback chain + system fallback; ligatures work via
  same-style run shaping plus `calt`. `app/boxdraw.rs` renders box-drawing
  and block glyphs with custom quad geometry (light lines ─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼,
  full/half blocks, shades ░▒▓, lower/left eighth blocks); the element
  snapshot diverts these cells to `box_quads`. 517 tests green. Phases
  1–8 done; remaining: 9 (shell integration), 10 (images/extras),
  11 (perf), 12 (parity audit).
- 2026-06-15: phases 9–12. Phase 9: OSC 133;A prompt marking on `Row`
  (travels into scrollback), `Terminal::prompt_lines`, `jump_to_prompt:N`
  action (cmd+up/down). Phase 10: `vt::url` detection (cmd-click opens a
  bare URL), `vt::search` engine + cmd+f overlay with live highlight and
  n/N navigation; kitty/sixel image sequences swallowed without corruption
  (rendering deferred). Phase 11: `vt/tests/throughput.rs` benchmark
  (~103 MiB/s), snapshot buffer pre-sizing. Phase 12: `docs/parity.md`
  full coverage map. All phases 1–12 complete; remaining work is the
  prioritized gap list in parity.md (chief: image rendering, resize
  reflow, damage-clipped paint). Test count 529 green.
- 2026-06-15: configuration UX. Native macOS menu bar (`set_menus`,
  items reuse config actions). Settings panel (cmd+,) writes changes back
  to the config file via `config::upsert` and live-reloads. Added a
  reusable text-input model (`app/textedit.rs`, tested) and wired editable
  fields into settings (font family, shell, foreground, background) and the
  search query (caret + cursor keys). Keymap now emits gpui's `secondary`
  modifier for `cmd`, so every ⌘ binding is ⌘ on macOS / Ctrl on
  Linux+Windows. 539 tests green.
- 2026-06-18: command macros + MCP server. New `macros` crate: a keystroke
  `Recorder` (captures typed command lines, segmented on Enter) and plain
  per-macro text storage under `~/.config/sinclair/macros`. Actions
  `macro_record` (toggle capture; names/saves via the rename modal) and
  `macro:<name>` (replay into the focused pane, paced off OSC 133 prompt
  marks with a fixed-delay fallback). New `mcp` crate: a dependency-light
  Model Context Protocol server over stdio (`initialize`/`tools/list`/
  `tools/call`). `sinclair mcp` bridges tool calls to the running instance over
  the existing single-instance socket (`ipc.rs` grew a JSON request/response
  protocol; `mcpbridge.rs` maps ops onto the active `WorkspaceView`). Tools:
  run_command, read_screen, list_macros, run_macro, list_tabs, focus_tab.
  575 tests green.
- 2026-06-23: UI, working-directory, and packaging pass (v0.3.0). About panel
  (`app/about.rs`): app menu → About Sinclair shows the icon, version, and the
  release date (stamped from the HEAD commit by `app/build.rs`), plus a repo
  link. Window chrome: the window opens with a transparent native
  title bar and `app/titlebar.rs` draws the strip — tabs folded in, drag-to-move
  (`start_window_move`), macOS traffic-light inset, and on Linux app-drawn
  minimize/maximize/close controls + resize edges (client-side decorations).
  Working directory: shells default to `$HOME` (was inheriting the launcher's
  cwd, e.g. `/` from Finder), and new windows now inherit the focused pane's cwd
  like new tabs/splits already did. Tests relocated: every crate's unit tests
  moved from inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules into a sibling `tests/` directory,
  compiled in-crate via `#[path]` includes with `autotests = false`; genuine
  integration tests (`vt`, `terminal`) declared as explicit `[[test]]` targets.
  Linux releases: `scripts/linux.sh` builds `.tar.gz`/`.deb`/`.AppImage` for
  x86_64 and aarch64, wired into the release workflow plus a `linux.yml`
  validation workflow. 583 tests green.
- 2026-06-24: Relay agent mesh. New `relay` crate (bundled sidecar binary, not
  in-process): a local mesh that lets coding-agent sessions (Claude Code, Codex,
  …) coordinate — a SQLite bus, MCP Streamable-HTTP transport, direct/channel/
  broadcast messaging, and a free `wait`-loop (one blocking SSE call, so idle
  agents cost nothing). The `relay` CLI manages the daemon (`start`/`stop`/
  `restart`/`status`) and launches agents under it (`launch`, foreground or
  `--background` monitored workers; `ps`/`kill`/`feed`), all keyed to a `--home`
  state dir. Sinclair integration: a **Settings → AI** section (master AI toggle,
  MCP-server toggle, Relay enable, start-on-launch, address, default agent — all
  config keys, no env vars), a **Relay** menu (Launch Agent…, Open Feed) that
  opens agents/feeds into splits, and `app/relay.rs` which starts/stops the
  bundled daemon off settings. `scripts/bundle.sh` ships `relay` beside `sinclair`
  in the `.app`. Roles: `relay role {list,info,create,edit,delete}` with an
  `$EDITOR` drop-in and TOML files layered project → user → built-in (seven
  built-ins embedded); `launch --role` injects the brief and applies the role's
  channels/agent/model as overridable defaults. See `docs/relay.md`.
- 2026-06-24: tiles, teams, and the AI menu. Tiles (`app/tiles.rs`): pane-layout
  presets (columns/rows/grid/main-bottom/main-right, generated for any N as a
  binary split tree) applied via the **Workspace** menu into a fresh tab; **Save Current
  Layout…** captures the focused tab's tree and stores it as JSON under
  `~/.config/sinclair/layouts/` (named via the rename modal). Teams (`relay team
  {list,info,create,edit,delete}`, `--json` for Sinclair; layered project → user →
  built-in, two built-ins): a layout + ordered roster. The keybind menu became an
  **AI** menu (shown when AI is enabled) with Launch Agent / Open Feed and a
  **Teams ▸** submenu that opens a team as a tiled set of agents (each pane runs
  `relay launch <member> --role <role>`). New actions `tile:`, `save_layout`,
  `open_team:`. See `docs/relay.md`.
- 2026-06-24: multi-tool agents. Three integration tiers in `relay`'s adapter
  table (`cli/agent.rs`): MCP-native (**claude** via `--mcp-config`, **codex** via
  `-c mcp_servers.relay.url` — both verified streamable-HTTP MCP), bridged
  (**ollama**), and terminal (`--cmd`/gemini). New `relay agent ollama` bridge
  (`cli/bridge.rs`): a tool-using loop against `/api/chat` that participates over a
  new plain-HTTP control plane (`/control/register|wait|send`), factored with the
  MCP tools onto a shared `bus.rs`. Settings → AI gained an **Agent tools** group
  with per-tool enable toggles (`agent-claude|codex|ollama|gemini`) and a **Test**
  button that probes reachability (CLI `--version` or the Ollama port) off-thread.
  See `docs/relay.md`.
- 2026-06-24: New Agent modal + movable utility windows. `app/newagent.rs`: a
  modal to add an agent to the current workspace — provider dropdown (enabled
  tools), name, and a role preset (from `relay role list --json`) or a custom
  description toggle. On create it spawns the agent into a split via the workspace
  `WindowHandle` (`view.update(|v, window, cx| ...)`, the same path the MCP bridge
  uses) and saves the definition; **AI → Agents** lists saved agents (relaunch on
  click) plus **Define Agent…**. The Settings and New Agent windows got a
  transparent-titlebar drag strip (`start_window_move`, inset past the macOS
  traffic lights) so they can be moved.
- 2026-06-24: macOS-style text-field keys. `app/textkeys.rs` centralizes a
  keymap shared by every modal (rename, settings, new agent): Cmd+←/→ to line
  ends, Option+←/→ by word, Cmd/Option+Backspace to delete line/word, Ctrl+A/E/K,
  Esc to dismiss, Cmd+W to close. `TextEdit` gained word/line nav + delete ops
  (unit-tested).
- 2026-07-01: recording export (1.6.0). New `export` crate renders an asciinema
  `.cast` to GIF or MP4/MOV/WebM: a `cast::Reader` (the recorder's inverse), an
  idle-cap/speed timeline, replay through `vt`, a software rasterizer (bundled
  JetBrains Mono) plus a global-palette GIF encoder and an ffmpeg video encoder.
  `sinclair export` drives it from the CLI; **Export Recording** (File menu +
  command palette, `export_recording`) runs it in the background on the latest
  recording and notifies when the file is ready. On macOS an optional fidelity
  renderer (`app/fidelity.rs`) shapes and rasterizes through gpui's CoreText text
  system for ligatures, exact fonts, and box-drawing geometry. Also fixed the New
  OS Tab picker: focus the image field on open (deferred to first paint) and
  match its colors to the guise theme so it no longer looks disabled.
- 2026-07-02: terminal power-feature pass (1.10.0–1.11.0). A broad sweep toward
  parity with modern terminals, every feature configurable and
  wired into Settings. Selection & navigation: smart selection (`vt::semantic`),
  hint mode (`hints`, cmd+shift+u), vi/copy mode (`copy_mode`, cmd+shift+space),
  middle-click paste, focus-follows-mouse. Command blocks: `copy_command_output`
  (cmd+shift+o) over OSC 133 marks. Fuzzy pickers on the guise Spotlight:
  clipboard history (cmd+shift+y), global search across tabs (cmd+alt+f),
  emoji/symbol (cmd+alt+e), snippets/workflows (cmd+alt+s), launch profiles
  (cmd+alt+p). Automation & privacy: regex output triggers (desktop notify),
  secret redaction on every copy path (both regex-backed, unit-tested). Reading
  aids: per-line timestamps (new monotonic `vt` `committed_lines` + a capture
  ring) and line annotations (`annotate`, cmd+alt+a). Appearance: auto
  light/dark theme (`observe_window_appearance`), `minimum-contrast` (WCAG,
  previously a dead setting), `background-opacity`, `background-image`, pane
  `badge`. Agent glance: an Activity sidebar dashboard (working/attention/idle
  per tab). See `docs/parity.md`; the remaining large/blocked items (persistent
  detachable sessions, kitty graphics, ssh multiplexing) are noted there.
- 2026-07-02: Notes is now built-in, backed by a bundled Rust vault server, and
  the plugin runtime PATH is fixed. The Notes plugin required `bun` at runtime —
  and failed with "spawn bun: No such file or directory" whenever the app was
  launched from Finder/Dock (a GUI launch inherits a bare PATH, not the login
  shell's). Two fixes: (1) `app/src/envpath.rs` adopts the login shell's PATH at
  startup so every spawned tool (plugin runtimes, agent CLIs, git/docker
  plugins) is found; (2) the Bun Notes plugin is replaced by a self-contained
  `notes` sidecar crate — an axum HTTP+WS server (the vault core ported to
  `std::fs`, `notify` file-watching, the CM6 web app embedded via include_dir)
  with a launcher mode that plugs into the existing `boot` webview flow. Notes
  is now File → Notes with no runtime dependency; shipped and signed beside
  `sinclair` on macOS and Linux. See `crates/notes/readme.md`.
- 2026-07-02: agent-native plugins (phase 1 of the plugin push). Plugins can now
  contribute tools to Sinclair's MCP server via a new `[[tool]]` manifest section
  (`id`, `description`, `param = "name | type | description | required"`). Every
  plugin tool joins the built-in terminal tools that `sinclair mcp` exposes, named
  `<plugin-id>_<tool-id>`, so any MCP client (Claude, or a relay-session agent)
  can call it. Tool calls route directly to the plugin's `[runtime]` with a
  `tool` request (no GUI needed), keeping the bridge process trivial. The bundled
  `sysinfo` plugin ships a working `sysinfo_stats` tool as the reference. This is
  the differentiator's first beat: a plugin isn't just UI for the user, it's a
  capability for their agents. Next: generalize surfaces, then the WASM runtime.
- 2026-07-02: plugin push phases 2–4. (2) Surface generalization — PluginWebView
  is decoupled from plugin::Plugin behind a WebviewSurface descriptor (Url/Entry/
  Boot; Boot is Runtime or Server), shared by plugin webviews and built-ins. Notes
  now uses a first-class surface with Boot::Server(ensure_server), retiring the
  synthetic-plugin + launcher-mode hack; the notes binary is server-only. (4)
  Capability declarations — plugins declare `capability = "…"` from a known set
  (commands/screen/network/filesystem/clipboard/notify), shown in the Plugin
  Manager ("accesses: …"); advisory under the process runtime, the vocabulary the
  WASM runtime will enforce; bundled plugins declare theirs. (3) WASM runtime
  foundation — manifest `[runtime] type = "wasm"` + `wasm = "…"` parses and
  validates; invoking one returns a clear not-yet-executable error; the full
  engine design (WIT host world, capability-gated imports, guest toolchain,
  migration) is in docs/plugins.md. Phases 2 and 4 ship; phase 3's engine is
  the scoped next build.
- 2026-08-04: Plugin system down to one runtime. Three runtimes served the
  plugins (spawn-per-event subprocess, warm stdio server, WASM) and the
  expensive one carried a single plugin while five still shelled out to `bun`.
  A new capability-gated `exec` host function - the host spawns, never through
  a shell, and hands back the output - let git/docker/sysinfo move into the
  sandbox, and promptdesigner followed using per-plugin storage plus a visible
  apply command instead of silently rewriting the user's rc file. Both
  subprocess tiers deleted; `bun`/`node` gone from the plugin path entirely.
  Trigger `invoke` now calls a plugin's tool, so a wasm plugin can finally
  receive events. `fetch` and `clipboard` stopped being stubs. Plugin-contributed
  web views retired with their JS bridge; Notes went back to being a first-party
  surface over the bundled sidecar. See docs/plugins.md.
- 2026-07-04: AI + input polish, shipped across 1.17–1.21. AI: an "Optimize
  tokens" setting compacts prompts sent to agents; quick-launch menu items for
  each configured provider (with reachability auto-verify); per-provider CLI
  flags (`agent-claude-args`, …, e.g. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`); a Team
  Builder window (manual or AI-guided) backed by a non-interactive
  `relay team save`; and agents are available on `ai-enabled` alone (Relay
  starts on demand). Input: fish-style autosuggestions — inline ghost text
  (accept with →/End), a completion popup, Tab-cycling, and an AI fallback,
  sourced from history/common-commands/paths/assist, driven by a new OSC 133;B
  input mark and per-pane history in `vt`. Workspace: tabs tear off into new
  windows (guise PaneGroup), keeping the live shell. Self-update: Sinclair checks
  GitHub on launch + hourly and offers to update — deferring to Homebrew/apt for
  managed installs, or swapping a manual `.dmg`/AppImage in place and relaunching
  via gpui's restart hook (`auto-update`).
- 2026-07-06: agent status, session resume, and git worktrees (1.23.0). Semantic
  agent state across the session. Status dots: every pane self-reports
  `working`/`blocked`/`done`/`idle`, drawn as a colored dot on the tab (new guise
  `on_item_dot` hook) and rolled up in the Activity sidebar; mesh agents show
  their state in the Relay panel. Hooks: `sinclair agent-status <state>` reports
  over the single-instance socket, addressed by a `SINCLAIR_PANE` token injected
  into every session; `sinclair agent-hooks install|uninstall [--project]` wires
  Claude Code's lifecycle hooks (idempotent install, surgical uninstall). Mesh:
  relay gains `report_status`/`wait_status` tools and a status column, riding the
  `/control` snapshot + events stream. Session resume closes step 4 of
  `docs/pauseresume.md` — an agent pane persists its launch command + native
  session id and relaunches *resumed* on restore, while plain shells restore as
  before. Git worktrees: `worktree_create`/`open`/`list`/`remove` as keybind
  actions and MCP/IPC verbs that open a tab at the worktree, with new
  `worktree_created`/`worktree_removed` plugin triggers. See `docs/parity.md`.
- 2026-07-24: kitty graphics + keyboard event types (1.30.0). The pinned vte
  has no APC callback, so `ESC _G … ST` never reached a Perform and the
  graphics protocol was unimplementable. A byte-level APC pre-parser
  (`vt/term/apc.rs`) now captures the block before vte discards it, and
  `vt/graphics.rs` decodes the payload: direct base64 in RGB (`f=24`), RGBA
  (`f=32`), or PNG (`f=100`), zlib-compressed (`o=z`) and chunked (`m=1`).
  Transmit/display/delete/query are answered with OK/error responses honoring
  the quiet level, and placement reuses the sixel compositor so images scroll
  with the grid; decode is bounded by dimension, pixel-count, and
  decompressed-size caps. File / shared-memory transmission, animation,
  unicode placeholders, and z-index/cropping stay deferred. Keyboard: the
  kitty protocol's press/repeat/release event types are encoded when a client
  sets `report_event_types` (gpui delivers key-up and flags auto-repeat with

- 2026-07-24: unattended agent teams. Teams launch **unattended**: a new
  `relay launch --skip-permissions` resolves each agent's own bypass *after* the
  role picks it (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` for claude,
  `approval_policy="never"` for codex, `--yolo` for gemini; a `--cmd` template
  and the ollama bridge are left alone), and `relay-team-autonomy` passes it to
  every member — nobody sits in each split to answer a prompt. Team members also
  now inherit the per-provider flags (`agent-claude-args`, …) that only solo
  launches used to get. Teams open in a **window of their own**
  (`relay-team-window`): the lead is the window's first pane and the rest split
  off it, one member per pane, each tab named after its member, focus on the
  lead, and the layout you were working in untouched. A team window is excluded
  from session save/restore — `session.json` holds one window (last writer wins),
  so a roster must not overwrite your real work, and replaying every member's
  `relay launch` would re-register a team the daemon may still be running.
  Known gap: the permission bypass does not cover Claude Code's separate
  first-run *folder trust* dialog, which still stops every pane the first time a
  team runs in an unfamiliar directory.
- 2026-07-27: the shared project sandbox. A project's panes and its whole agent
  team can now run inside **one container** instead of on the host, turning
  `relay-team-autonomy`'s permission bypass from a promise into a boundary.
  Self-contained: `docker` or `podman` is the only dependency — no VS Code, no
  `devcontainer` CLI, no Sinclair image to pull. The `container` crate grew
  `Sandbox` (a detached, keepalive-backed container with mounts, env, user,
  network, and resource ceilings), `Recipe` (a generated Dockerfile that layers
  the agent CLIs onto a configurable base, tagged by recipe hash so a rebuild
  only happens when the recipe changes), `Mount`, `adopt` (label discovery plus
  ownership, so a container VS Code created is entered and never removed), and
  a `devcontainer.json` reader on `config`'s JSONC parser. The project is
  **identity-mounted** — the same absolute path inside and out — which is what
  keeps git worktrees valid from both sides and removes any need for a path
  translation layer. Relay stays on the host: `relay launch --sandbox` changes
  only the final exec, rewriting the bus URL to the engine's gateway host and
  handing the agent its MCP config at the path the container mounts it. Opening
  a team brings the container up first. UI: a Sandbox submenu under both File
  and AI with a live status line, a Sandbox section in the Containers panel,
  fourteen `sandbox-*` settings in Settings → AI, and six bindable actions.
  Known gap: a worker started with the MCP `spawn` tool runs on the host — the
  daemon is not told which container a session belongs to. See
  `docs/sandbox.md`.
- 2026-07-27: tab renaming, tab context menu, and window dragging (issue #15).
  Renaming a tab was already an action, a View-menu item, a palette entry, and a
  documented keybinding — and the dialog **never painted**: its host element had
  no size, so the modal's absolutely-positioned backdrop, drawn in the deferred
  pass, had nothing to resolve against. The dialog was created and re-rendered
  every frame, off screen; the feature looked missing because it was invisible.
  `tab-title-show-host` was dead in the same way — parsed, written to
  `settings.json`, a toggle in Settings and a promise in the help text, and no
  consumer. Tab labels now honour it, with a strip that only fires on something
  genuinely shaped like `user@host:` (so `https://example.com:8080` and
  `nvim: main.rs` survive) and never rewrites a label the user typed; the flag
  rides in a cell the reload path updates, so toggling needs no restart.
  Right-clicking a tab now opens a menu — rename, split, close, close others —
  built by the host from a new `PaneGroupEvent::ContextMenu`; its handlers defer
  their action, since dispatching straight into the same window re-enters an
  update in progress. Window dragging: every tab bar along the layout's top edge
  now drags, not just the top-right one, and the space reserved for the window
  controls drags rather than being dead padding. Dev containers: `mounts` and
  `remoteUser` from a project's `devcontainer.json` are now applied, not just
  parsed. See `docs/devcontainers.html`.
- 2026-08-03: configurable side columns. The two side drawers used to be the
  same thing twice — one identical activity rail on each side listing every
  panel, and one panel visible at a time per side. Each side is now its own
  **dock**: an ordered stack of collapsible sections, composed independently,
  Zed-dock style. The rail stays but lists only *that* side's sections, so the
  left and right columns are finally different columns; several sections can be
  open at once, sharing the leftover height and each scrolling on its own.
  Composition lives in `app/src/root/dock.rs`, deliberately gpui-free so the
  interesting part is testable (`crates/app/tests/dock.rs`): resolving config
  tokens, revealing a section wherever the user actually put it, and moving one
  dock to the other. Sections persist as **tokens**, never indices — a plugin
  panel carries an index into a list that shifts when the plugin set changes, so
  storing one would quietly rebind a saved slot to a different plugin. An
  unresolvable token (uninstalled plugin) is skipped and left in the file, so a
  reinstall restores its slot. `Action::Sidebar` gained reveal semantics: a
  bare side toggles the dock, `<side>:<token>` expands the section on whichever
  side holds it, which is what keeps `sidebar:left:containers` working after
  Containers has been moved right. Five new settings keys (`sidebar-left`,
  `sidebar-right`, `sidebar-collapsed`, `sidebar-left-width`,
  `sidebar-right-width`) and a **Settings → Sidebar** designer that edits them
  through the same `compose_docks` the workspace renders from, so the two can
  never disagree. Two new sections: **Worktrees** (the repo's git worktrees,
  click to open one in a tab, on the existing `worktree.rs` plumbing) and
  **Notes** (the vaults the Notes editor has opened; the editor itself stays a
  webview, since a markdown editor is unusable in a 260px column). Both cache
  on expand rather than resolving during render — one is a `git` subprocess and
  the other a file read.

  Footprint: no new dependencies (the Notes section reads the sidecar's
  `vaults.json` directly rather than depending on the `notes` crate, which is a
  binary-only tokio+axum server). A closed dock builds no elements at all, so
  the default costs nothing. The chrome of an open dock allocates nothing per
  repaint: rail icons and section headers click by `(side, index)` through
  `dock::toggle_at` instead of formatting a token payload only to parse it back
  and re-resolve it, built-in labels/glyphs are `SharedString::new_static` over
  constants (`label_upper`), and the plugin lookups iterate to `nth` rather than
  collecting a `Vec<&Plugin>` to index once. Measured: +0.1MB RSS to open both
  docks with six sections; CPU during sustained terminal output is unchanged
  within noise (6.2% open vs 6.3% closed — the grid renderer dominates and gpui
  coalesces repaints); 200 toggle cycles move RSS by 0.5MB.
- 2026-08-29: the kitty protocols, in full. Graphics moved into
  `vt/graphics/` (control model, decode, media, store) with dispatch in
  `vt/term/gfx.rs`, and now answers all eight actions. Transmission gained the
  file, temp-file and shared-memory media with `O=`/`S=` windows — the one
  place `vt` touches the OS, confined to `graphics/media.rs`, because a
  terminal that will not read them does not implement the protocol. Images
  gained numbers alongside ids, the whole delete-specifier table, source
  cropping, cell-box scaling, cell offsets, z-index (including below the cell
  background), placement ids, and animation (frames, gaps, composition modes,
  loops, playback state).

  Unicode placeholders needed somewhere to put a cell's decoded coordinates.
  Rather than widen every cell, the zero-width slot became a tagged `u32`
  holding either one combining mark or a placeholder's row, column and
  image-id high byte — the same four bytes a `char` took, so no grid or
  scrollback block grew (`size_of::<Cell>()` is 24 either side). The renderer
  keeps one texture per image and clips with a content mask, so a crop, a cell
  offset, a scrolled-off top and a placeholder's single-cell slice are all the
  same operation.

  Keyboard: all five enhancement flags over the full functional-key table —
  F13–F35, keypad, media, lock and modifier keys, the last synthesised from
  the window layer's modifier-state changes. The modifier parameter carries
  super, hyper, meta and the locks, so cmd+arrow reports instead of vanishing.
  The remaining limits are the window layer's, not the encoding's: gpui
  reports no hyper, meta, or num lock, and does not name keypad keys
  separately on macOS.

  Three resource bugs found auditing the result, all the shape a runaway
  stream produces: the pane byte budget was recomputed by walking every frame
  of every image on every transmit (quadratic — a flood of small images cost
  93us apiece on accounting alone; the store now keeps a running total, and
  the same flood costs 0.01s where it cost 0.40s); virtual placements were
  charged to nothing at all, and animation frames were unbounded; and an
  on-screen animation asked for a repaint every vsync however far off its next
  frame was, where it now sleeps until the frame is due. Measured after: 8
  panes idle at ~95MB (~200KB per pane), 60k scrollback rows ~13MB, idle
  threads all blocked, parser ~104 MiB/s.

  Also: an open-modifier click on a filesystem path opens it with the
  desktop's default handler rather than only revealing it, and hovering
  underlines it — but only once the candidate resolves against the pane's cwd,
  so text that merely looks like a path stays inert. And `unified-tab-bar`
  (on) keeps the tabs-as-titlebar layout; off gives an ordinary titlebar with
  the tab bars beneath it. The split controls sit at the titlebar's right edge
  either way, acting on the focused pane when they are in a shared one.
